Regarding logic

1. Never ever use try catch in the models. They should not handle errors on their own. Let them throw Exceptions.

Regarding semantics

1. '=' should have one space behind and one after.
2. Tab structure should be followed strictly
3. No SOP statement anywhere except for controllers.
4. Class structure : instance variables, constructors, get/set pairs, instance methods, static methods.
5. variables name should be meaningful. No 'm' for message, 'c' for connection etc. Usual rule -> make all case of class name small.
	eg. Message class -> message object name

Will be updated as and when I see deviation from the usual flow
